<h2>GEIGER Risk Score</h2>

The GEIGER Indicator solution allows users to calculate their GEIGER score, a measure of the cybersecurity risk to which they and their SME are exposed. Based on the characteristics of an MSE and the results of the GEIGER Indicator calculation, users receive recommendations for actions to mitigate cybersecurity risk.

The GEIGER Indicator score can be further subcategorized into two scores: Device score and User score, 
together they form the Global GEIGER score. More precisely, for each [GEIGER threat]() defined, a score is calculated for ‘User’ and ‘Device’ based on metrics received from different tools.

The GEIGER Indicator contains 4 key points described as below. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;[**User/Device Score**]() </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The User Score describes knowledge of cyber security and weather following recommendations. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Device Score shows the status of the device against threats.
