<h2>GEIGER Indicator Algorithm</h2>

A threat-based cybersecurity risk assessment algorithm must be supported by a data model and data sources that are equally threat- centric. In this section, we describe how a threat-based view of SME cyber-systems produces a data model supporting a threat-based approach to cybersecurity risk assessment. We outline the data required to enable our approach and describe the algorithm that transforms the data into a cybersecurity risk indicator.
