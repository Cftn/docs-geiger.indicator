There is an additional component named GEIGER Cloud Adapter that will oversee the process of searching and synchronizing data between the GEIGER Toolbox and GEIGER Cloud. Besides, the Cloud Adapter also allows for searching and synchronizing data with the Toolbox Core.

The plugins may be added at any time by the user and integrate seamlessly into the framework. No modification on the core application is required to add new indicators of cyber threats, recommendations, or functionalities. They all may be added using project external code.
