Based on the characteristics of an MSE and the results of the GEIGER Indicator calculation, users receive recommendations for actions to mitigate cybersecurity risk. The GEIGER Indicator score can be further subcategorized into two scores: Device score and User score, together they form the Global GEIGER score. More precisely, for each GEIGER threat defined, a score is calculated for \u2018User\u2019 and \u2018Device\u2019 based on metrics received from different tools. The GEIGER Indicator contains 4 key points described as below. User/Device Score The User Score describes knowledge of cyber security and weather following recommendations. The Device Score shows the status of the device against threats. Aggregate Score The Aggregate Score is an aggregate score that is average among User, Device score. SME Score The SME Score is for the company. The Company owner only has the MSE score. The MSE Score shows the average of all Employee\u2019s total Score who agreed to share their score to supervisors. Recommendations The recommendation is suitable action for each user based on the type of threats. The users get the installation link of plugins with recommendation.","title":"GEIGER Risk Score"},{"location":"implementation/","text":"Implementation of GEIGER Indicator","title":"Implementation"},{"location":"indicator-algorithm/","text":"GEIGER Indicator Algorithm A threat-based cybersecurity risk assessment algorithm must be supported by a data model and data sources that are equally threat- centric. In this section, we describe how a threat-based view of SME cyber-systems produces a data model supporting a threat-based approach to cybersecurity risk assessment. We outline the data required to enable our approach and describe the algorithm that transforms the data into a cybersecurity risk indicator. The goal's of GEIGER indicator provides three score. This figure shows overview of GEIGER scores. The indicator calculate user and device score from each physical device (Android, Windows, IOS etc.) and owner. And the indicator provide the aggregate score based on user and device score on physical device. The aggregate score consist of all physical device which is paired on one of device (main device). The calculation of SME score is only allow company owner (CEO). In this calculation, the indicator calculate SME score using the aggregate score of the paired employees. This calculation is hierarchy as shown on figure.. The supervisor calculate the risk score with employees to aggregate score. The company owner calculate SME score when reach aggregate score of employees under CEO position. The indicator algorithm designed based on threats metric. The organization of cyber security announce priority of threat and risk which is more dangerous nowadays. In GEIGER project, this metric is provided as 'global data' such as ':Global:threat', ':Global:profile', 'Global:recommendation'. This threat impacts consist of three impacts (high, medium, low) about SME actions. The indicator algorithm works based on three factor, positive and negative, countermeasures. In this concept, when user do some action on their physical device it would be effect as positive or negative on indicator algorithm. This figure shows formula of indicator algorithm. This formula support risk score using global data, metrics data.

Before starting to calculate the GEIGER score, check the existing GEIGER score nodes in LDS for creation or update (Step. 5). These works as upper are initial work on GEIGER Indicator workflow. Now, to calculate GEIGER score as a threat for SMEs, the indicator waits for the metric nodes (\u201cdata:metric\u201d) on LDS and uses a listener and checks if it exists (Step. 6). Finally, The GEIGER score nodes store to LDS and then check the existence of the enterprise nodes for calculation of GEIGER MSE nodes (Step. 7).","title":"Flowchart"},{"location":"imple/source-code/","text":"Source Code The implementation of GEIGER Cybersecurity Risk Indicator develop using Dart and Flutter.

It consists of three main modules. From a GEIGER Indicator perspective, all data is collected from the Local Data Storage (LDS) using LDS API, Listener. The output of the GEIGER Indicator is stored in the LDS. The LDS listener notify the events of nodes (Create or Update) to GEIGER Indicator (Step. 1). The Listener of Indicator delivers the metric data selected though node path to core module (Step. 2). The Indicator Core calculates GEIGER score using Indicator Algorithm and sends the results to the storage connector (Step. 3).
